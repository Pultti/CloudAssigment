## IaaS
**Infrastructure as a Service**
```diff
IaaS gives you rented computing resources over the internet. Think of it like renting a computer you can access from anywhere. It's your job to manage the OS, software, and basically everything that's not the actual hardware.


+ PaaS is like IaaS but with more stuff managed for you, like databases, development frameworks, and operating systems. It lets you focus on coding and building your app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
