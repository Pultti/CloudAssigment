# Frequently asked questions

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is a tech model where computing resources like servers, storage, and software are delivered over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, you can rent or lease these resources from a cloud service provider. This makes it easier and often cheaper to scale, collaborate, and manage data.

## What is Vendor Lock-in?
Vendor lock-in occurs when a company becomes too dependent on a single cloud service provider, making it difficult and costly to switch providers. This can lead to increased costs and reduced flexibility.

- **Symptoms**: Heavy use of proprietary APIs, services, or tools that are specific to one provider.
- **Risks**: Higher costs, less negotiating power, dependency on provider's stability.
- **Mitigation**: Design with portability in mind, consider multi-cloud strategies, and regularly review contractual obligations.
